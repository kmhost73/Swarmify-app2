Act as a seasoned 10x developer to evaluate the overall plan, code, and test functionality of https://swarmify.app/ other resources include https://github.com/kmhost73/Swarmify-app2/tree/main where we can directly update/iterate, and C:\Users\kpmcq\Desktop\swarmify-app\src. https://g.co/gemini/share/249b00329b07
